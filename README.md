## PITCH

Core gameplay:

- Launch your noodly eyeballs one-by-one at the stations to pick up ingredients
- Rewind & bring the ingredient to the right station to trigger a task!
- But, you don't have to wait: 
- Launch another set of eyes to do a 2nd task. You are a beholder after all!
- Careful not to get too tangled!
- Can you use all your eyes optimally? Customers are waiting!

Stations:

### SCRATCHPAD / IDEAS

Stretch Goals:
- Turn customers to stone with a BEAM if you are getting a little overwhelmed.
    - or like a FREEZE everyone beam (meter slowly charges) 
    - Freezes the "new customer" timer or expiring orders
- Mixing mini-game
- Jiggle bone (requires new version of Godot)
- Post Jam Goal: Multiplayer co-op is sort of simple: each player can select any unassigned Eye.
